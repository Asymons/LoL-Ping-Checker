# LoL-Ping-Checker

Simple League of Legends ping checker that uses ICMP to accurately determine ping.
Client pings the server 100 times to get an average ping and determine the maximum and minimum ranges.


#TODO
-Add IP Checker (Code somewhere in repo)
-Implement server to retrieve data from clients for future data visualization. 
-Multi-Server functionality (Code pretty much there)
